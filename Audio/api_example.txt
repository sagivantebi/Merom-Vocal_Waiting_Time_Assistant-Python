hi chat! i have the following protocol for answering a customer calling with a technical problem with their router: .{'value': 'no internet', 'children': [{'value': 'Could you please check if the router is on, and the power led is blinking?', 'children': [{'value': 'no', 'children': [{'value': "Okay, turn on the router with the power button. It's at the bottom of the router. Is the power led on?", 'children': [{'value': 'no', 'children': [{'value': "Oh, that's a problem I can't solve. Please wait for my human colleague to connect"}]}, {'value': 'yes', 'children': [{'value': 'Great! does the internet work now?', 'children': [{'value': 'yes', 'children': [{'value': 'Great! if everything is working fine, you can disconnect now. Have a nice day!'}]}, {'value': 'no', 'children': [{'value': "Oh, that's a problem I can't solve. Please wait for my human colleague to connect"}]}]}]}]}]}, {'value': 'yes', 'children': [{'value': 'Try to turn off the router, wait five seconds and turn on the router. Is the internet still out?', 'children': [{'value': 'yes', 'children': [{'value': 'Great! if everything is working fine, you can disconnect now. Have a nice day!'}]}, {'value': 'no', 'children': [{'value': 'I see, which model of router do you have?', 'children': [{'value': 'model A1', 'children': [{'value': "Okay, in the front of your model there are two LEDs titled 'LAN' and 'internet'. please go to the router, and say aloud which LEDs are on and which are off", 'children': [{'value': 'LAN led is on, internet led is off', 'children': [{'value': 'Alright, this problem is a little too complicated for me. Please wait for my human colleague to answer'}]}, {'value': 'LAN led is off, internet led is on', 'children': [{'value': 'Alright, try to plug the cable in the back of the router to a different socket and check if the internet works now', 'children': [{'value': 'yes', 'children': [{'value': 'Great! if everything is working fine, you can disconnect now. Have a nice day!'}]}, {'value': 'no', 'children': [{'value': "Oh, that's a problem I can't solve. Please wait for my human colleague to connect"}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}.
The customer said "I don't have internet", I said  "Could you please check if the router is on, and the power led is blinking?" 
The customer said "no the power led isn't on", I said "Okay, turn on the router with the power button. It's at the bottom of the router. Is the power led on?" 
The customer said "no the router is connected but the led is off". What Should I say to the customer according to the protocol?.
Please answer in the format: 'value' : <reply> 
 'summary' : <summary of the conversation between me and the customer> $$$
